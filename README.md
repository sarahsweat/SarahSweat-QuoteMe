In this repo you'll find a Rails 5.1 app using `react_on_rails` with react router to create a Quote-serving site. It should look something like this:

**Your challenge will be to complete the following steps:**

_Clone (don't fork) the repo then change the remote to your own repository. Push your changes to your own repository and send me a link to when done._

1. Try to run the site and make sure it works. If it doesn't, fix it! *hint: it's not working. you're gonna need to debug it*
- [ ] Root path loads first quote
- [ ] Next link loads next quote
- [ ] Previous link loads previous quote
- [ ] Next link hidden on last quote. Previous link hidden on first quote.

2. Extract the quote body (text/author) and encapsulate in a new React component.

3. Add a feature to allow the input of new quotes.

4. Add a feature to display a random quote.

5. When you're finished, send me a link to your repository and celebrate!

**Hot Tips:**

- How you fix/implement is up to you. I am looking to understand how you work, and how you think.
- There's a seed file to get you started.
- You can run everything with `foreman start -f Procfile.dev -p 3000`
- Don't overthink it! It's gonna be fine!
